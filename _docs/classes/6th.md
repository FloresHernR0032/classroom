## Weekly Journal Prompt

In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?

In your response, consider the following:

- How does precision affect the outcome of a program?
- What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?
- Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?

Remember to use Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to structure your response.

Howdy! I am out today and will return on Monday. Please behave for your sub. If I have already given you an alternate assignment, please continue with that assignment. If I have not given you an alternate assignment, please complete the Hour of Code assignment.

Every should be at their own computer or at a table with their own Chromebook.No one should be partnered up or sharing a computer.

## Agenda

### 1. Hour of Code

- Open [hourofcode.com](https://hourofcode.com/us) in a new tab.
- Choose any activity that interest you.
- In your GitHub journal, let we know which activity you completed. (Use today’s date as the heading).

### 2. Weekly Journal Prompt

- If you’ve added your Hour of Code activity to your journal, you do not need to add anything additional for this week.

> Note: We're doing this because a number of you asked if you could learn Python. This is a one-day experiment, and we'll discuss your thoughts towards the end of class.

### 2. Weekly Journal Prompt

_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.

2. Choose one of the sensors, and write a paragraph explaining how that sensor functions.

> Note: In your paragraph, describe how the sensor you chose works and how it helps the Sphero BOLT operate. Does it measure light, speed, direction, or something else? Provide details about how the sensor gathers data and how the robot uses that information to move or react to its surroundings. Try to give an example of how this sensor might be used in a specific activity or challenge.

Remember to use the appropriate structure so that you receive credit for your work.
