## Agenda

- Everyone should have their individual python assignments. Please continue with your individual assignment.

## Weekly Journal Prompt

In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?

In your response, consider the following:

- How does precision affect the outcome of a program?
- What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?
- Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?

Remember to use Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to structure your response.

## Weekly Journal Prompt

_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.

### 2. Journal Entry

In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?

> Note: Think about the basic concepts you’ve learned, such as variables, data types, or loops. How do you think these fundamentals will help you as you continue to learn more advanced programming concepts? Provide specific examples from your experience to explain your thoughts.
