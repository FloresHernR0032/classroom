## Weekly Journal Prompt

_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.

## Agenda

### Game Program & Design

#### 1. Journal Entry 

Think about a video game that you enjoy playing. In a paragraph or more, describe the aspects of that game that make it enjoyable or successful.

Consider elements like gameplay mechanics, graphics, storyline, music, and character design. Why do you think these aspects work well together, and how do they contribute to the overall experience of the game? Be as specific as possible in your analysis.

#### 2. Unity Essentials
