[Mobile Application Development](https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=19&pt=2&ch=127&rl=768) will foster students' creativity and innovation by presenting opportunities to design, implement, and deliver meaningful projects using mobile computing devices. Students will collaborate with one another, their instructor, and various electronic communities to solve problems presented throughout the course. Through data analysis, students will identify task requirements, plan search strategies, and use software development concepts to access, analyze, and evaluate information needed to program mobile devices. By using software design knowledge and skills that support the work of individuals and groups in solving problems, students will select the technology appropriate for the task, synthesize knowledge, create solutions, and evaluate the results. Students will learn digital citizenship by researching current laws and regulations and by practicing integrity and respect. Students will gain an understanding of the principles of mobile application development through the study of development platforms, programming languages, and software design standards. The six strands include creativity and innovation; communication and collaboration; research and information fluency; critical thinking; problem solving, and decision making; digital citizenship; and technology operations and concepts.
