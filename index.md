This is the online  companion for [Ms. Whitby’s](https://www.judsonisd.org/Domain/6785) Computer Science course at Wagner High School. Parents and students can reference this site for assignment details, project ideas, and reference materials. 

# Computer Science Fundamentals
The Computer Science Fundamentals course follows [Project STEM’s](https://projectstem.org) Computer Science Explorations 1  curriculum. CS Explorations 1 is an introductory computer science course that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. Students learn the foundational concepts and skills of computer science. They will explore using computers to solve problems and to express themselves. The course is designed to be engaging and relevant to student lives. Students build, remix and share animations, games, stories, music and art in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

# Computer Science I
The Computer Science I course follows [Project STEM’s](https://https://projectstem.org/high-school/cs-fundamentals) Computer Science Explorations 1  curriculum. CS Python Fundamentals is an introductory-level course. Students learn problem-solving strategies, software design, and the foundations of computer science using two key tools in the Project STEM programming environment.

# Project-Based Alternative
All students in any of Ms. Whitby’s courses are encouraged to produce a guided project. Past students have worked on projects related to data science, sports analytics, business productivity, music production, and gaming—the range of projects available to students is only limited by their own creativity. Students who chose the project-based alternative will be evaluated on the progress of their projects rather than on the standard curriculums.
